# Email Setup Guide for Petriko Website Quote Requests

## âœ… Current Status

The website now has a fully functional quote request system that will send emails to `petricolimited@gmail.com` when customers submit quote requests.

1. **Form Submission**: Client fills out the multi-step form with:
   - Contact information (name, email, phone, location)
   - Project details (service type, budget, description)
   - Optional reference images

2. **Email Notification**: An email is automatically sent to `petricolimited@gmail.com` containing:
   - All client information
   - Project details and requirements
   - Any uploaded reference images as attachments
   - Client's contact information for easy follow-up

3. **Client Confirmation**: Client sees a success message confirming their request was received

## ðŸ“§ Email Configuration Required

To activate the email functionality, you need to set up Gmail App Password:

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security
3. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Go to Google Account > Security > App passwords
2. Select "Mail" as the app
3. Copy the 16-character password generated

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:
